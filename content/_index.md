# The AppDev Guide
[The Red Hat AppDev Setup Guide {{%icon fa-github%}}](https://github.com/rayploski/appdev-setup) is a site for the busy developer looking to use Red Hat AppDev technologies.

This guide covers the basics of setting up a development environment on a new Mac. Whether you are an experienced programmer or not, this guide is intended for everyone to use as a reference for setting up your environment or installing Red Hat related tools and technologies.

Some of the environments we will set up are [Java] (http://java.com), [Node](http://nodejs.org) (JavaScript), [Python](http://www.python.org), [CPlusPlus](http://www.cplusplus.com) and [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org). Even if you don't program in all of them, they are useful to have as many command-line tools rely on them. We'll also show you some useful daily use applications. As you read and follow these steps, feel free to post any feedback or comments you may have.

All contributions to the guide are welcome. Please help add support for other libraries and languages. To make a contribution please use our [contribution template](.github/CONTRIBUTION_TEMPLATE.md).

**Looking for contributors to maintain and extend the documentation.**
