If you want to fork Spacemacs safely use the develop branch where you handle the update manually.\n (Optional) Install the Source Code Pro font.  If you are running in terminal you\u0026rsquo;ll also need to change font settings of your terminal.\n Launch Emacs. Spacemacs will automatically install the packages it requires. If you get an error regarding package downloads then you may try to disable the HTTPS protocol by starting Emacs with  emacs --insecure Or you can set the dotspacemacs-elpa-https to nil in your dotfile to remove the need to start Emacs with --insecure argument. You may wish to clear out your .emacs.d/elpa directory before doing this, so that any corrupted packages you may have downloaded will be re-installed.\n Restart Emacs to complete the installation.  Purcell\u0026rsquo;s Emacs configuration This is Purcell\u0026rsquo;s emacs configuration tree, continually used and tweaked since 2000, and it may be a good starting point for other Emacs users, especially those who are web developers. These days it\u0026rsquo;s somewhat geared towards macOS, but it is known to also work on Linux and Windows.\nInstallation To install, clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d, i.e. ensure that the init.el contained in this repo ends up at ~/.emacs.d/init.el:\ngit clone https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, further third-party packages will be automatically downloaded and installed. If you encounter any errors at that stage, try restarting Emacs, and possibly running M-x package-refresh-contents before doing so.\nDoom Emacs Doom is a configuration for GNU Emacs written by a stubborn, shell-dwelling, and melodramatic ex-vimmer. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t originally intended for public use, but can be considered a hacker\u0026rsquo;s starter kit.\nInstallation git clone https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d cd ~/.emacs.d cp init.example.el init.el # maybe edit init.el make install Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to run make every time you modify init.el!\nVisit the wiki for a more detailed guide on installing, customizing and grokking Doom.\n"

Here\u0026rsquo;s the latest recommended way to install various JDKs from Oracle, OpenJDK and even Azul. We will install and manage multiple versions of Java on MacOS.\nInstallation Manage multiple JVMs with jenv First you should check if Java is already installed\n$ java -version  If you see an output like below then Java is already installed on your machine so skip to Add Java to PATH.\njava version \u0026quot;1.8.0_45\u0026quot; Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_45-b14) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.45-b02, mixed mode)  If you don\u0026rsquo;t see the output like above then you need to install Java on your system.\nUsing the Oracle installer Please download the macOS version from the Oracle website.\nUsing Homebrew brew update brew tap caskroom/versions  Then, install latest version of Java 10 via:\nbrew cask install java  or install Java 8 using:\nbrew cask install java8  Check if Java is correctly installed by running the java -version command again.\nAdd Java to PATH Add JAVA_HOME to your environment variables by adding the line below to your env.sh (see iTerm2 section if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a env.sh file).\nexport JAVA_HOME=\u0026quot;`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8`\u0026quot;  If you are using Java 10, use the following:\nexport JAVA_HOME=\u0026quot;`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 10`\u0026quot;  You should have Java working now. Two popular IDE alternatives for writing Java are Eclipse or IntelliJ.\nInstall jenv While it isn\u0026rsquo;t a wholesale fix for the various java environments you may need, it does the trick for most use cases. jenv will allow you to quickly switch from version to version of a JVM. There are some tricks to getting it to work with various vendors (OpenJDK, Oracle, Azul)\nbrew install jenv  Install OpenJDK Currently there is no \u0026ldquo;official\u0026rdquo; OpenJDK install via HomeBrew.

For more information see the documentation.\nFirst, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to tell Go the location of your workspace. We\u0026rsquo;ll do this by adding some environment variables in your shell config file (usually .bash_profile, .bashrc or .zshrc).\nexport GOPATH=$HOME/go export GOROOT=/usr/local/opt/go/libexec export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin Create your workspace Create the workspace directories tree:\n$ mkdir -p $GOPATH $GOPATH/src $GOPATH/pkg $GOPATH/bin  $GOPATH/src This is where your Go projects are located $GOPATH/pkg A folder that contains every package objects $GOPATH/bin The compiled binaries home\nWrite your first program Create a file in your $GOPATH/src, for example hello.go, and input the following code\npackage main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;hello, world\\n\u0026#34;) } Run the program by running:\n$ go run hello.go  If you wish to compile it and move it to $GOPATH/bin, then run:\n$ go install hello.go  Since we have $GOPATH/bin added to our $PATH, you can run your program from anywhere:\n$ hello  Import a Go package Besides creating your own packages you can import and use other packages in your Go code. To do so you\u0026rsquo;ll use the go get command:\n$ go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux  The command above will import the package mux into this directory $GOPATH/src/github.com/gorilla/mux.\nYou can then use this package in your Go programs like this:\npackage main import ( \u0026#34;net/http\u0026#34; \u0026#34;log\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github.com/gorilla/mux\u0026#34; // Your imported package ) func YourHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { w.Write([]byte(\u0026#34;Gorilla!\\n\u0026#34;)) } func main() { r := mux.NewRouter() // Routes consist of a path and a handler function.  r.HandleFunc(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, YourHandler) // Bind to a port and pass our router in  log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(\u0026#34;:8000\u0026#34;, r)) } Format your code Go has a built-in tool that automatically formats Go source code.\nTo format a single file run:\n$ gofmt -w yourcode.go  You can also format an entire package (Note that the command is different from formatting a single file):\n$ go fmt path/to/your/package  Generate documentation With the godoc command you can generate documentation from your code and read documentation from other packages.\n$ godoc fmt # documentation for package fmt $ godoc fmt Printf # documentation for fmt.Printf $ godoc -src fmt # fmt package interface in Go source form  You need to respect some spec in order to document using godoc.
